# GPROI
GPROI is a simple Github Flavoured Productivity Tracker. 

I love the github commit graph and it always motivates me to work more and commit more. With this as motivation in my mind, I made this productivity tracker to help me remain motivated and also to help me flex my productivity. 

Current version `1.0.0` can be buggy and lacks several 
features. 

---

##  Stack used: 
GPROI uses Node.js and Express for backend, LowDB as database and EJS as template engine.

## TODO: 
 - [ ] Fix the padding and design issues in the graph. 
- [ ] Make Electron App for better distribution. 
- [ ] Add Export and Import database feature. (I guess that will be useful for backups.)
